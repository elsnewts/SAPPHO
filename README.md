This project is an open-access reproducible experiment, creating descriptive metadata from Sappho magazine (1972-81). The metadata created can be viewed as two spreadsheets showing issue information and page information, with table headings directing what is recorded. For more information detailing the files, please see the Sappho Volume 1 lab notebook. The data interpretation can be viewed within the article 'Magazine Metadata Methods:
Analysing the Content and Form of 1970s Lesbian-Feminist Magazine Sappho, Volume 1'. 

Please use and explore both this data and Sappho magazine, but if using any work uploaded here, cite accurately 'Eleanor Newton' as author, and the GitHub link to the data.
